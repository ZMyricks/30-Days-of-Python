# Exercises: Level 2
# The following is a list of 10 students ages:
# ages = [19, 22, 19, 24, 20, 25, 26, 24, 25, 24]
# Sort the list and find the min and max age
# Add the min age and the max age again to the list
# Find the median age (one middle item or two middle items divided by two)
# Find the average age (sum of all items divided by their number )
# Find the range of the ages (max minus min)
# Compare the value of (min - average) and (max - average), use abs() method
# Find the middle country(ies) in the countries list
# Divide the countries list into two equal lists if it is even if not one more country for the first half.
# ['China', 'Russia', 'USA', 'Finland', 'Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark']. Unpack the first three countries and the rest as scandic countries.
